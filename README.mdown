## About
Lanyard is a WebGL based map.

## Requirements
Lanyard requires a WebGL enabled browser.

## Notes
Keep in mind that Lanyard is not a completed product and you will probably not be able to see any eye candy at the moment. Unless you're a developer who's interested in tweaking out a fragment shader or writing tests, you may want to wait for a release version of Lanyard.
