## About

Lanyard is a WebGL based map.

## Requirements

Lanyard requires a WebGL enabled browser. At the time of this writing, there are no final release WebGL browsers. You will need to obtain a nightly build of Firefox (Minefield), Chrome (Canary Build), or Webkit. Keep in mind that Lanyard is not a completed product and you will probably not be able to see any eye candy at the moment.
